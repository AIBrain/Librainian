h1. Wolfram API

h2. This library provides:

* An easy way of solving mathematical operations.
* An easy way of requesting informations about specific words, topics, etc. (WIP)
* Well documented and clean source code.
* CLS-compliancy

h2. In order to use, you need:

* An application identifier (AppID) from Wolfram. You can get one for free, you just have to register your application.
* .NET Framework 4.0

h2. A very simple example

<pre>
var client = new WAClient("XXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX"); // replace that with your AppID.
var solution = client.Solve("33^4 + sqrt(12^2 + 13^2)"); // replace with any mathematical operations

// 'solution' now contains the solution by Wolfram Alpha.
// report bugs! :)
</pre>
